# Final Project: $He_NLi^+$ Clusters with Monte Carlo Simulations

In this project are found the Python scripts developed to carry out MonteCarlo simulations on a system of $He_NLi+$ clusters. 

`HeLi_clusters.py` is the main module that contains the classes and functions to perform the simulation.

`runs.py` performs batch calculations for a given range of number of He atoms.

The project is mainly based in the ref. [_J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2005, 1, 1045-1054_](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ct050072m). While the $He-He$ and $He-Li$ potentials are gathered from refs. [_J. Chem. Phys. 1991, 94, 8047-8053._](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.460139) and [_Chem. Phys. Lett. 2001, 343, 429-436_](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0009-2614(01)00717-5), respectively.
