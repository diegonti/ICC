# The results show the tipycall sigmoid curve that an autocatalitic reaction presents.
# The reactions starts slowly because low concentrations of Mn2+ are available, 
# but with increasing the Mn2+, since it helps to increase the velocity of reaction, 
# makes the reaction go even faster, so a quick growth is shown for the increase of product and decrease of reactant,
# until the concentration of reactant lowers and the rate slows down.

# All methods perform well and give very similar results, but the simple euler method differs a little bit from the others.
