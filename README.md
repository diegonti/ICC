# Introduction to Scientific Computing
Practical Sessions problems for the Introduction to Scientific Computing course of the _Atomistic and Multiscale Computational Modelling_ Master Degree. Course 2022-2023.

The aim of this course is to see how different mathematical models and theories can be discretized and solved using computer programs.

In here we will find topics from numerical integration and differentiation, to more complex projects such as Monte Carlo simulations or solving differential equations.

There is also a more advanced Final Project that uses Monte Carlo simulations to compute the energy of $He_NLi$ clusters.
